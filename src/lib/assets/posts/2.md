excerpt: This post demonstrates how to include a Svelte component in a Markdown post.
---

You can inject any Svelte components you want into Markdown! Just import them in a `<script>` tag and then use them wherever you like.

For that matter, you can inject any HTML anywhere! (Note that you cannot use Markdown _inside_ Svelte components or HTML, however. Any opened tag must be closed before returning to Markdown.)
